NOTE: The coral UI changed for every version of AEM (6.0, 6.1, 6.2). Make Sure to choose the proper version for development.

Basic Definitions: 
	- Coral UI : The coral UI is proprietary UI language by Adobe. This UI works on CSS classes. When a CSS class is set on a UI element, based on the class the rendering will happen.
	- Granite UI : Granite UI is implementation of coral UI. The Coral UI is UI element and granite UI uses coral UI to implement specific functionality. Ex: All OOTB components under "/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form" uses granite UI. Check the render.jsp for more clarity.
