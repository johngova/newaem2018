NOTE: Everything is resourceType from AEM 6.0, so if anything needs to be customized the resourceType should be checked and the path of the url must be taken into consideration.
		Next important thing is when you dont find any short url (ex: localhost:4502/assets.html : here assets.html is short url which is referred to "/libs/dam/gui/content/assets/jcr:content"), search for this url in crxde search and pick the link from /libs.
		
		All the panels in the AEM are designed based on the Page structure which contains - head, body, actions etc..
		


Assets Panel Customization:
/libs/dam/gui/content/assets - this is the UI part of the console.
jcr:content/
	head - head section of the UI where clientlibs and parameters required for the panel are set.
	body - this place is where the actual content exists. (this part may not exists for some panels).
	actions - where the UI options ( which are highlight when an asset is selected ) are configured.
	
	
	How to customize:
		If anything needs to be customized, the above mentioned path must be changed.
			- for adding any extra option when an asset is selected - add it under "actions/selection". add sling:resourceType property which refers to the granite component.
