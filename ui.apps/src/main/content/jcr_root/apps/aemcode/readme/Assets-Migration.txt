								Content Migration
===================================================================================================

Rules to be followed for asset/content migration:

1) Validate what type of content to be migrated and is it supported by AEM (Dont Worry! Most of the formats will be supported).
2) Check the source systems and validate if all the properties (metadata) can be mapped to AEM.
3) Check how much content is to be migrated and how many days it will take to migrate the content.
4) Write scripts to read the content from source systems [execute the scripts multiple times and check if any exceptions occur or any mismatch in data is found].
5) Copy the assets to a server where the AEM exists and asset upload process will start.
6) Use Existing tools like ACS commons - CSV importer to import content from a csv file.
